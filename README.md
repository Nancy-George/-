# Warning!
1. the test .csv file is not the realworld dataset. It is produced in random.
2. In initial, I really want to get some real dataset from some public database. I failed to find the data that the trial includes data and shows up. BUT after this update for the course, I will continue to do this project. It's really meaningful and astonishing. --- 2024.06.17
3. Some functions later:
   - accept the information provided by users, after I check the information;
   - not only the trial data, I want to show the symptoms of disease. Because when I search the information about diseases and medicines, I found the differences are not only in the performences of medicine, but also quite in symtoms.
   - now it's just scipt file. I want to make a easy website for it.
4. If you know any method to get the data, Please connect me. Thank you. Have a good day!
